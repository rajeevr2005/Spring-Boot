@Configuration is an annotation in spring that designates a class as a source of bean definitions.

In other words, when we annotate a class with @Configuration

1. we are telling Spring that this contains methods that define beans using the @Bean annotation.
2. Spring will automatically process the class to create and configure all the beans defined within it.
3. The @Configuration class also ensures that each @Bean method is only called once and the same bean instance is returned each time, which is important for managing singleton beans.


@Configuration Spring ko bolta h ki is class ke ander bean bnane wali setting(Configuration) likhi hui h.

Spring internally kya karta h
    Spring @Configuration class dhundta h
    Uske ander @Bean methods check karta h
    Method run karta h
    jo object return hota h - Bean bn jata h
