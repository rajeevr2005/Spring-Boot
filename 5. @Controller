1. @Controller is a specialized version of @Component designed specificially for handling web requests in spring MVC.

2. Spring automatically looks for mrthods in a @Controller annotated class maps HTTP requests to these methods
(e.g., using @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, etc).

3. It also handles view resolution (e.g., returning HTML Pages or templates).

@RestController

1. It is a specialized version of @Controller designed for Restful web services.

2. It combines the behaviour of @Controller and @ResponseBody

3. You don't need to annotate each method with @ResponseBody to return data like JSON.

4. use @RestController when building REST APIs that retuurn data(JSON, XML, etc) directly instead of views(HTML Pages).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Service

1. @Service is a specialization of @Component
2. It's intended to indicate that the class provides some business logic within the application.
3. In short, using @Component instead of @Service will work the same, but it's more meaningful to use @Service to indicate that the class provides service or business logic.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Repository

1. @Repository is a specialization of @Component intended specifically for data access layer(DAO) classes that interact with databases.

2. Oone of the primary roles of @Repossitory is to provide a mechanism for translating database-related exceptions into Spring's DataAccessException hierarchy.

3. It reduces the complexity of error handling and makes the codemore readable and maintainable.
